## it is suggested that you create an account on SDSS CASjobs III page and submit the following sql query there instead of running it on the SDSS skyserver page.
## the result of the sql query is very large for the browser to handle and there's a good chance it will crash. 

select
plateX.plate, plateX.mjd, 
PhotoObj.ra, PhotoObj.dec, PhotoObj.ObjID, 
PhotoObj.modelMag_u, PhotoObj.modelMag_g, PhotoObj.modelMag_r, PhotoObj.modelMag_i, PhotoObj.modelMag_z, 
specObj.fiberID, specObj.z

## we have selected the above parameters for download.

from
PhotoObj, specObj, plateX

## we want the above mentioned parameters from these data objects. refer to the SDSS schema browser regarding the data objects and the parameters available for download in them.

where
specObj.bestObjid = PhotoObj.ObjID 
AND plateX.plateID = specObj.plateID 
AND specObj.class = 'qso' 
AND specObj.zWarning = 0 
AND PhotoObj.modelMag_u < 22.3 
AND PhotoObj.modelMag_g < 22.6 
AND PhotoObj.modelMag_r < 22.7 
AND PhotoObj.modelMag_i < 22.4 
AND PhotoObj.modelMag_z < 20.5

## the first four options here are to make sure that we are getting information pertaining to quasars, whose redshift is determined without any errors and whose 
## data is consistent across the different data objects mentioned - PhotoObj, specObj and plateX.
## the remaining 5 limits set on SDSS u, g, r, i & z magnitudes are from the paper and are in place as the error in photometry is large beyond these values of 
## apparent magnitude.
