My project was to reproduce the results of the Richards et al (2001) paper on the "Colors of Quasars".  Measuring the redshift of astronomical objects is a very daunting task, spectroscopy needs hours of telescope time in constrast to imaging. Assuming a template spectrum for quasars, their colors will depend on the redshift of the quasars. Attempts at estimating redshift of extra-galactic objects using their colors is not a new idea (reference). The advantage that the SDSS brings to the table is it's filter design. The u, g, r, i & z bands are designed such that there is minimal to no overlap between two adjacent filters - unlike the Johnson filters U,B,V,R,I which have been the standard in astronomy for decades. This minimal overlap leads to better individual band photometry and therefore better estimates of the color. Using this technique, Richards et al (2001) show that their redshift estimates are %% correct.

Two weeks into the project, it was getting harder and harder to piece together the original data set. So, i resorted to creating a new data set of quasars and their colors from SDSS DR9. While the original paper worked with 2625 quasars from the SDSS DR3, SDSS DR9 has 145665 quasars. Using the SDSS u, g, r, i & z band apparent magnitudes, I plotted the color vs redshift relationship for quasars that lead to the clustered plot shown.
