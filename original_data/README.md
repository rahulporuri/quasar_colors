Contains the data from the original paper by Richards et al. (2001) titled "Colors of 2625 quasars between z (0,5) from the SDSS DR3". Data pertaining to only ~890 quasars can be retrieved from the online sources mentioned earlier on vizier, simbad or ned. these were quasars from outside the dr3 used by the paper. And acquiring the rest of the quasars from dr3 is an uphill task as the schema browser for dr3 is different from dr9 and hence, sql query code used to query dr9 won't work on dr3. 

to be implemented - 

* construct the color-color, color-redshift and median color-redshift relations.
* plot the spatial distribution of quasars.
* histogram of redshifts.
